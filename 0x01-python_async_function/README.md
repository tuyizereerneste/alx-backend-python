0x01. Python - Async

TASKS:

1. Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

2. Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

3. Create a measure_time function with integers n and max_delay as arguments that measures the total execution time for wait_n(n, max_delay), and returns total_time / n. Your function should return a float.

4. Write a function (do not create an async function, use the regular function syntax to do this) task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay and returns a asyncio.Task.

5. Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n. The code is nearly identical to wait_n except task_wait_random is being called.
